===========Caution===========
This Source Code was only tested with linux
Some parts may not work with windows or macos
Some parts of this code may be unstable as I haven't been able to test all of it

===Note for Arch Linux users===
You can also add my repository which will let you install jewl as a package
Please note that titanium will also contain other projects I work on
If you don't want this then building the source is the better option
otherwise add the following to /etc/pacman.conf
