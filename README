=========Installation========
git clone https://github.com/Pyrerune/Jewl.git
run configure (In a Separate Directory (good habit to learn)) -p /path/before/bin/directory (if it is going in /usr/bin, the path to use is /usr)
run sudo make

===========Caution===========
The Entire Interpreter was Rewritten in Java Recently
It (for obvious reasons) is NOT Backwards Compatible (See wiki and changelog)
I will continue to Maintain the older version but not as often
if you would like to use the older version use git clone -b Legacy https://github.com/Pyrerune/Jewl.git

===Note for Arch Linux users===
I am working on updating the package repository with the new and old versions
You can also add my repository which will let you install jewl as a package
Please note that titanium will also contain other projects I work on
If you don't want this then building the source is the better option
otherwise add the following to /etc/pacman.conf

[titanium]
Server = https://pyrerune.github.io/titanium/$arch
